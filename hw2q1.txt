Part (a):
Every action line in a makefile must start with a:

TAB

Part (b):
Look at this makefile and answer the following question. Assume this makefile is in the current directory, and all required files are available. Now we run the command

make clean
make shape1

Which action(s) will get called? What compiler command(s) with what exact parameters will get executed as a result of the action(s)?

Part (c):
What is the purpose of a .PHONY rule?

The .PHONY rule serves to avoid having a problem with a file of the same name by telling Make which targets aren't files (for instance, if you had a file named "clean," using .PHONY would allow the makefile to run "make clean" without problems). This also allows the makefile to run faster.

Part (d):
What are acceptable names for a makefile? Select all that applies.

Makefile
makefile
